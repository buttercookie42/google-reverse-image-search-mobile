# Google Reverse Image Search

Addon for Firefox for Android that allows one to search by an image on Google

Long-tap an image and select ''Search Image on Google'' from the context menu.
If ''Search Image on Google'' does not appear, the image cannot be searched. Some images are unsearchable even if the option does appear in the context menu.

Requires Firefox for Android 18.0+

##Todo
* Change selector context so that only http/https located images can be searched. Currently, the option appears in the context menu for data uri image
even though they are not searchable.
